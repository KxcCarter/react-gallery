# Kenneth R Carter's React Gallery

## Description

Current Version --
Base-mode is complete. Clicking a photo shows the description. Clicking the heart icon adds a like.

TODO: Rather than replace the img tag I would like to overlay the text on top of it so that you can still see the image after you click it.

### Note --

After adding in Material-UI, GalleryItem.js is no longer being used, but I have not yet deleted it from the project.

### Update:

I totally missed that we were supposed to add in a title field in basemode, so I went back and did that. I know it's passed the due-date.

## Stretch Goals

TODO: When an image is clicked, the entire height of the card changes. Make the card's height static so that no matter the size of the image or the amount of text will change the dimensions of the card.
I've mostly fixed this, but I'm sure there is a better way.

TODO: Implement uppy for image upload.
